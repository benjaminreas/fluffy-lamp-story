This is the start of Ben's story!
Ben woke up and immediately hopped in his boat!
He had business to take care of.
Ben remembered that is was officially Lobster Fest at Red Lobster and he HAD to go.
All the sharks in the ocean couldn't stop him from making it to the ocean side Red Lobster.
As Ben paddled past shark after shark he saw .... (a merge conflict making the next line nonsensical)
Tae learned about BSTS and found them interesting!
